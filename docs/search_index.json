We have three main tools: jsPsychMaker: Create experiments with jsPsych, randomize participants balance between conditions, etc. jsPsychMonkeys: Release monkeys to a jsPsych experiment using the R package {targets}, docker and {RSelenium}. jsPsychHelpeR: Standardize and automatize data preparation and analysis of jsPsych experiments created with jsPsychMaker. Contributors Gorka Navarrete Herman Valencia "],["intro.html", "Chapter 2 Reproducible experiments 2.1 Open and reproducible experimental pipeline 2.2 Automatization", " Chapter 2 Reproducible experiments We use different technologies to develop experiments. Some examples are Psychopy, Qualtrics, Limesurvey, jsPsych, Gorilla, etc. Each of these has advantages and disadvantages and, in general, there are pragmatic aspects to take into account when adopting one or the other (cost, type of experiment - EEG/behavioral, lab/online -, lab history and available resources, …). We opted mainly for jsPsych to run behavioral experiments because it is an open source javascript library, based on standard web technologies, and can be used online and offline. In the last years, we started working on a set of tools to create jsPsych experiments (jsPsychMaker), simulate participants (jspsychMonkeys) and standardize and automatize the data preparation and analyis (jsPsychHelpeR). Our final goal is to have a big catalog of tasks available to use in the jsPsychMaker repo. Each of the tasks should run with jspsychMonkeys to create virtual participants. And each task will have a sister script in jsPsychHelpeR to fully automate data preparation. 2.1 Open and reproducible experimental pipeline To replicate an experiment from a publication is not trivial. One of the main goals of this sytem is to be able to create, share and reproduce an experiment, its data, and data preparation and analysis without any extra effort. Furthermore, all the components of the pipeline should be Open Source, which allows reviewers, collaborators, etc. to check and run the code. This also makes it accessible to anyone with a computer and access to the internet, eliminating cost constrains. With this system you can create a paradigm, simulate data and prepare data and analysis almost automatically (including anonimization). The system output is standardized, so names of variables and the structure of the data are predictable. Finally, the plots, tables, reports and analysis are reproducible, so you can get enerything ready with simulated data, preregister or even better, go for a registered report and just relaunch the data preparation and analysis when the participant’s data arrive with a single command. 2.2 Automatization We tried to make a few basic things right, but this is an evolving project, and some things are more complex than one would want.

Outline Download jsPsychMaker Go to the folder canonical_protocols and edit the config.js file to select the tasks you need Open index.html in your browser 1) Download jsPsychMaker Open RStudio and run the following two lines in the console. This will download the last stable jsPsychMaker version v0.2.0. When you finish, a new RStudio project named jsPsychMaker-0.0.2 will open. # Make sure you have {usethis} installed if (!require(&#39;usethis&#39;)) install.packages(&#39;usethis&#39;); library(&#39;usethis&#39;) # Download last stable jsPsychMaker version to the Downloads folder usethis::use_course(url = &quot;https://github.com/gorkang/jsPsychMaker/archive/refs/tags/v0.2.0.zip&quot;, destdir = &quot;~/Downloads/&quot;) # Alternatively, download the dev version: # usethis::use_course(url = &quot;gorkang/jsPsychMaker&quot;, destdir = &quot;~/Downloads/&quot;) 2) Edit configuration Go to folder canonical_protocols and edit config.js. The variable tasks should contain the name of an array of the tasks we want to run. See a list of tasks available in the repo. 3) Run experiment The experiment is ready to run on your computer. Open index.html in Google Chrome or your favourite (and up to date) browser. 3.2 jsPsychMonkeys: Simulate participants See the jsPsychMonkeys chapter for more detailed instructions. jsPsychMonkeys uses Selenium inside a Docker container to guarantee each session is a clean session. On Linux it’s use and configuration is trivial, but on Windows it can be trickier. Outline Download jsPsychMonkeys Setup Run Monkeys 1) Download jsPsychMonkeys if (!require(&#39;usethis&#39;)) install.packages(&#39;usethis&#39;); library(&#39;usethis&#39;) usethis::use_course(url = &quot;gorkang/jsPsychMonkeys&quot;, destdir = &quot;~/Downloads/&quot;) 2) Setup Run setup: source(\"setup.R\"). This will install the packages needed. Ubuntu You may need to install some system libraries first: sudo apt install libssl-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev libxml2-dev Mac (?) Windows Download and install docker: https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/ (~ 500MB) 3) Run Monkeys Open run.R and follow the instructions. Mainly: Open _targets.R file: rstudioapi::navigateToFile(\"_targets.R\") Edit parameters_monkeys_minimal. For example, launch participants 1 to 5 to the 999 protocol locally: parameters_monkeys_minimal = list(uid = 1:5, local_folder_tasks = \"Downloads/999\") Run Monkeys!: targets::tar_make() 3.3 jsPsychHelpeR: Prepare data See the jsPsychHelpeR chapter for more detailed instructions.

The full details about the available tasks can be checked in this document. We are in the process of filling all the tasks details to the document, but in the meantime, you can check the full list of tasks in the Github repo. Below, a table with an overview of the available tasks: 4.2 Experiment configuration In the config.js file you can find the main parameters to control how your experiment works. 4.2.1 Main parameters pid = 999999;: Number of protocol online = true;: true if the protocol run in a server, false if runs locally max_participants = 3;: If you have between participants conditions (participants are assign to only one of a number of conditions), this is the max number of participants per condition random_id = false;: true if you want to assign a random id to participants, false if the participant needs to input an id max_time = \"24:00:00\";: Max time to complete the protocol (HH:MM:SS; Hours:Minutes:Seconds) accept_discarded = true;: If an user is discarded (over max_time), shall be allowed to continue given there are available slots? debug_mode = false;: When testing the protocol it shows DEBUG messages, creates the DB tables if they don’t exist… It also forces the tasks with random order of items to avoid the randomization so the jsPsychMonkeys can have a reproducible behavior. 4.3 Order of tasks first_tasks = ['Consent'];: The protocol will start with these tasks in the specified order last_tasks = ['Goodbye'];: These tasks will be presented in the specified order after randomly_ordered_tasks Create as many blocks as needed: randomly_ordered_tasks_1 = ['TASK1', 'TASK2'];: Block of tasks in random order randomly_ordered_tasks_2 = ['TASK3'];: Block of tasks in random order secuentially_ordered_tasks_1 = ['TASK5', 'TASK4']; // Block of tasks in sequential order The final array of tasks can be build combining the above blocks. The order of the tasks in the arrays starting with “random” will be randomized. tasks = ['first_tasks', 'randomly_ordered_tasks_1', 'secuentially_ordered_tasks_1', 'randomly_ordered_tasks_2', 'last_tasks'] 4.4 online-offline protocols jsPsych uses standard web technologies (HTML, CSS y Javascript), so that protocols should run in any modern browser (updated, please). We recommend Google Chrome just because our test suite runs with Google Chrome, so we will catch its specific issues earlier. 4.4.1 Offline If you want to run a protocol locally (on your computer, on a lab computer), you need to: set online = false; in the config.js file double click index.html jsPsychR will use IndexedDB to store the participants’ progress and balance between conditions. The output csv files will be Downloaded to the Download folder of the computer where the protocol runs. If any of the tasks imports an html file, the Offline protocol will give a CORS error. 4.4.2 Online Tu run a protocol online, set online = true;. You will need a couple more things: Install MySQL A file .secrets_mysql.php with the contend below Define a route to .secrets_mysql.php in controllers/php/mysql.php require_once '../../.secrets_mysql.php'; THIS FILE SHOULD NOT BE PUBLICLY VISIBLE FROM THE BROWSER Upload the files to a server :) &lt;?php /* DO NOT UPLOAD TO PUBLIC REPO */ $servername = &quot;127.0.0.1&quot;; $username = &quot;USERNAME OF THE DATABASE&quot;; $password = &quot;PASSWORD OF THE DATABASE&quot;; $dbname = &quot;NAME OF THE DB&quot;; ?&gt; jsPsychR will use MySQL to store the participants’ progress and balance between conditions. The output csv files will be Downloaded in the .data/ folder inside the protocol folder in the server. 4.5 Between-subject tasks The variable all_conditions in config.js let’s you define the Independent Variables (IV) and levels for the between-subject tasks: If there is no between-subject task: all_conditions = {\"protocol\": {\"type\": [\"survey\"]}}; If there are between-subject tasks: all_conditions = {\"NAMETASK\": {\"name_IV\": [\"name_level1\", \"name_level2\"]}}; jsPsychR will randomize participants to the different conditions keeping the unbalance between conditions to the minimum possible. 4.6 Developing tasks Remember to place an if (debug_mode == 'false') before the randomization of the item order so when running in debug_mode, the items are not randomized. This is important so the behaviour of the jsPsychMonkeys is reproducible: if (debug_mode == 'false') NAMETASK = jsPsych.randomization.repeat(NAMETASK,1); 4.6.1 Need help implementing a task! If you need help developing new tasks, you can open a new Issue in the jsPsychMaker Github. We will ask you to add the details about the task in the NEW tasks document. Once the task is implemented, our goal is to always end up having a sister task preparation script in jsPsychHelpeR. You can try to create the preparation script and do a Pull request, or ask for help opening a new Issue in the jsPsychHelpeR Github. 4.7 Technical aspects When index.html is launched: Check if there are available slots When an uid is assigned: questions array is created between-participants conditions are assigned and stored in the DB (mysql if online, IndexedDB if offline) Each question, timeline or conditional question needs to have a: data: {trialid: 'NameTask_001', procedure: 'NameTask'} The trialid identifies the trial, and the procedure makes possible to find that trial so participants can continue the tasks where they left, know when participants finished the tasks, etc. This is done in Mysql if online, IndexedDB if offline. 4.7.1 jsPsychMaker main changes on a task Start of a task questions = ( typeof questions != &#39;undefined&#39; &amp;&amp; questions instanceof Array ) ? questions : []; questions.push( check_fullscreen(&#39;NameOfTask&#39;) ); NameOfTask = []; Each item data: {trialid: 'NameOfTask_01', procedure: 'NameOfTask'} End of experiment if (debug_mode == &#39;false&#39;) NameOfTask = jsPsych.randomization.repeat(NameOfTask, 1); NameOfTask.unshift(instruction_screen_experiment); questions.push.apply(questions, NameOfTask) questions.push({ type: &#39;call-function&#39;, data: {trialid: &#39;NameOfTask_000&#39;, procedure: &#39;NameOfTask&#39;}, func: function(){ if (online) { var data = jsPsych.data.get().filter({procedure: &#39;NameOfTask&#39;}).csv(); } else { var data = jsPsych.data.get().filter({procedure: &#39;NameOfTask&#39;}).json(); } saveData(data, online, &#39;NameOfTask&#39;); } }); 4.7.2 Conditional questions var question001 = { type: &#39;survey-multi-choice-vertical&#39;, questions: [{prompt: &#39;&lt;div class=&quot;justified&quot;&gt;¿Usted se ha vacunado contra el coronavirus / covid-19?&lt;/div&gt;&#39;, options: [&#39;&amp;nbsp;Si&#39;, &#39;&amp;nbsp;No&#39;], required: true, random_options: false, horizontal: false}], data: {trialid: &#39;PVC_001&#39;, procedure: &#39;PVC&#39;} }; PVC.push(question001); var question001_1 = { type: &#39;survey-multi-choice-vertical&#39;, questions: [{prompt: &#39;&lt;div class=&quot;justified&quot;&gt;¿Usted se va a vacunar contra el coronavirus covid-19?&lt;/div&gt;&#39;, options: [&#39;&amp;nbsp;Si&#39;, &#39;&amp;nbsp;No&#39;, &#39;&amp;nbsp;No estoy seguro&#39;], required: true, random_options: false, horizontal: false}], data: {trialid: &#39;PVC_001_1&#39;, procedure: &#39;PVC&#39;} }; var if_question001_1 = { timeline: [question001_1], data: {trialid: &#39;PVC_001_1_if&#39;, procedure: &#39;PVC&#39;}, conditional_function: function(){ let data = (JSON.parse((jsPsych.data.get().values().find(x =&gt; x.trialid === &#39;PVC_001&#39;))[&#39;response&#39;])[&#39;Q0&#39;]).trim(); if((data) == &#39;No&#39;){ return true; } else { return false; } } }; PVC.push(if_question001_1); 4.8 Common ERRORS If you get the following error in the console: Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'procedure') Run this in the console: for (var i = 0; i &lt; questions.length; i++) { console.log(i + questions[i].data[&quot;procedure&quot;]) } It will stop in one of the items. Go to the console, check the array questions and go to the number that failed. When you know the task and item that fails, you probably need to add: data: {trialid: 'TASKNAME_ITEMNUMBER', procedure: 'TASKNAME'} "],["jsPsychMonkeys.html", "Chapter 5 jsPsychMonkeys 5.1 How to simulate participants 5.2 Parameters", " Chapter 5 jsPsychMonkeys jsPsychMonkeys: Release monkeys to a jsPsych experiment using the R package {targets}, docker and {RSelenium}.

You can use Virtualbox to install Ubuntu. Once there, you can use this manual to prepare the system to run R &amp; RStudio 5.2 Parameters Edit the Parameters section of the _targets.R file. The minimal set of parameters needed are: parameters_monkeys_minimal = list( uid = 1:10, # User id&#39;s for the participants. local_folder_tasks = &quot;Downloads/tests/2&quot; # Location of your jsPsych protocol ) 5.2.1 Release the Monkeys! If you want a sequential process: targets::tar_make() If you want a parallel horde of monkeys: targets::tar_future_make(workers = 2) You can set as many parallel workers as you want. With targets::tar_make_future(workers = future::availableCores() - 1) you can have as many workers as your computer cores minus 1.

You can use targets::tar_watch(seconds = 10, outdated = FALSE, targets_only = TRUE) to see the live progress: 5.2.2 Launch monkeys on a server You will need a .vault/SERVER_PATH.R file that contains the path where the protocols are located in your server: server_path = \"http://URL_OF_YOUR_SERVER/PROTOCOLS_GENERAL_FOLDER/\" With the server_folder_tasks you will set the subfolder where the protocol is located. In the example below the monkeys would go to, http://URL_OF_YOUR_SERVER/PROTOCOLS_GENERAL_FOLDER/1 parameters_monkeys_minimal = list( uid = 1:10, # User id&#39;s for the participants. server_folder_tasks = &quot;1&quot; # Location of your jsPsych protocol ) 5.2.3 Parameters for parameters_monkeys_minimal There are a few parameters that can be useful: uid_URL = TRUE: The uid is passed in the URL (e.g. &amp;uid=1) local_folder_tasks = rep(\"Downloads/tests/test_prototol\", 25): Passing a vector of multiple tasks will make the monkeys to complete all of them. keep_alive = TRUE Keep the docker container alive after completing the tasks DEBUG = TRUE Activate DEBUG mode. Lot’s of stuff will show up in the console. open_VNC = TRUE Activate DEBUG mode and open a VNC container to see the monkey’s progress. screenshot = TRUE The monkeys will take a picture of all the pages they see. The .png files are stored in outputs/screenshots debug_file = TRUE Activate DEBUG mode and store all the console output in the outputs/log big_container = TRUE Sets the Shared memory size (/dev/shm) to 2 gigabytes.

Use a completely open, reproducible and automatic process to prepare your data Data preparation ready for &gt; 50 tasks (see here the list of tasks) Get tidy output dataframes for each task, and tidy general dataframes for the whole protocol Include tests for common issues Automatic reports with progress, descriptives, codebook, etc. See QuickGuide for basic instructions. 6.1 How to prepare data Every jsPsychMaker task has a sister script on jsPsychHelpeR to help prepare the data automatically. run_initial_setup() will try to make sure you have all the dependencies, folders, etc., and a customized _targets.R file adapted to your protocol, so data preparation can run automagically. We use the {targets} (https://github.com/wlandau/targets) package. The whole process can be reproduced running targets::tar_make() A nice visualization of all the pre-processing steps can be seen with targets::tar_visnetwork(targets_only = TRUE) The file _targets.R contains the important parameters and calls to all the functions used when running targets::tar_make() To see more detail about any specific step, you can: Go to the relevant function Load the input parameters of the function with debug_function(NAME_OF FUNCTION). Alternatively, manually use targets::tar_load(NAME_OF_TARGET) Run the code step by step as you would normally do 6.1.1 Output tables and plots Raw data (anonymized) are in data/raw_data_anonymized.csv Plots, tables and reports are in outputs/plots, outputs/tablesand outputs/reports respectively. Dataframes for different stages of data processing can be seen in outputs/data 6.2 Create your own reports You can use any of the template reports in the _targets.R file, or create your own reports. We will start opening one of the template reports: rstudioapi::navigateToFile(\"doc/report_analysis.Rmd\"). Edit the RMarkdown file to adapt it to your needs. If you already did targets::tar_make(), when running targets::tar_load(DF_analysis) the dataframe DF_analysis will load in your Environment. Go back to the _targets.R file: Look for # Analysis report and uncomment the following lines: # tar_render(report_analysis, &quot;doc/report_analysis.Rmd&quot;, # output_file = paste0(&quot;../outputs/reports/report_analysis.html&quot;)), When you finished editing and uncomented the tar_render command, go back to the run.R file: targets::tar_make() 6.3 Create new tasks To create the correction script for a new task, you should do: create_new_task(short_name_task = \"NAMETASK\") This will create a new file from a template correction script (R_tasks/prepare_TEMPLATE.R) and adapt it to your short_name_task to make everything as standardized as possible. All the prepare_NAMEOFTASK.R scripts on the R_tasks/ folder have been created using the same template. When you finish implementing the correction script, please do a Pull request so we can add you script to the pool, and help us filling up details about the task in the NEW tasks document. 6.4 DEBUG tasks At the begining of each of the R_tasks/prepare_NAMETASK.R scripts you will find a commented debug_function(prepare_NAMETASK) line. When running it, it will load the input parameters for the task. From there, you can work inside of the preparation scipt as you would normally do in a R script. If you get the error “Error in debug_function(prepare_NAMETASK) : could not find function ‘debug_function’ debug_function() does nor work” you will need to load all the functions in the R/ folder first. You can do this in one of three ways: CONTROL + P shortcut will work if the run_initial_setup() completed correctly (at least on Ubuntu systems). Run targets::tar_load_globals() Or directly, source all the scripts in the R/ folder: invisible(lapply(list.files(\"./R\", full.names = TRUE, pattern = \".R$\"), source)) 6.5 Technical aspects 6.5.1 How trialid’s are processed See PRFBM: If more than one response per screen Item: PRFBM_04 Responses: {\"daño\":\"Parcialmente en desacuerdo\",\"beneficio\":\"Parcialmente en desacuerdo\"} final trialids: PRFBM_04_beneficio and PRFBM_04_daño 6.6 Common ERRORS 6.6.1 run_initial_setup(): x Can find server credentials in &#39;.vault/.credentials&#39; x 0 tasks found for protocol &#39;TU NUMERO DE PROYECTO&#39;.
