# What is jsPsychR?

`jsPsychR` is a group of tools to help create experimental paradigms with [jsPsych](https://www.jspsych.org/), simulate participants and standardize the data preparation and analysis.

We have three main tools:

- [jsPsychMaker](https://gorkang.github.io/jsPsychR-manual/#jsPsychMaker): Create experiments with jsPsych, randomize participants, etc.

- [jsPsychMonkeys](https://gorkang.github.io/jsPsychR-manual/#jsPsychMonkeys): Release monkeys to a jsPsych experiment using the R package {targets}, docker and {RSelenium}.

- [jsPsychHelpeR](https://gorkang.github.io/jsPsychR-manual/#jsPsychHelpeR): Standardize and automatize data preparation and analysis of jsPsych experiments created with jsPsychMaker.
